/* maths in graphics programming mainly deals with 2 things - matrices and vectors 
 * matrix -> array of numbers, and matrices can be useful for positioning objects in 3D world
 * vector -> it has 2 types directional and positional vectors, it has direction and magnitude 
 *
 * maths is used in transformation, scaling and rotating*/

/* we will use the glm library for doing the maths stuff in OpenGL
 * https://github.com/g-truc/glm 
 * it is a header only library i.e. there is no cpp file all is implemented in the .h files
