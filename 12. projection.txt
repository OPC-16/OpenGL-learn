projection is an idea of going from having cooridinates in 3D world (characters, terrains etc) to map those cooridinates 
to our window where we actually are rendering 

projection (perspective) can also perform scaling of objects (to make them small or big) in 3D world where farther 
the obj is the smaller it is

In orthographic projection (usually used for 2D), the farther objects are of same size as the nearer objects
In perspective projection (usually used for 3D), the farther obj are of small size

In projection, we convert the cooridinates into normalized device cooridinates i.e. between -1 to 1 
If any calculated device cooridinate happens to be 2 or something then it is not rendered as it is outside of our view
